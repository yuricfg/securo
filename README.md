<h3 align="center">Finance apps want your data. This one doesn't.</h3>

<p align="center">
We believe personal finance should actually be <em>personal</em>. No corporation should sit between you and your financial data. Securo is an open-source finance manager that runs on your own infrastructure, giving you full visibility into your accounts, spending, and habits, without surrendering a single byte to third parties. Take back control.
</p>
